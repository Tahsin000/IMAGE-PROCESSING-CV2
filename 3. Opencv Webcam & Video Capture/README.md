## Title: "Real-time Video Capture and Display using OpenCV"

**Description:**

This Python code snippet demonstrates how to capture video in real-time using OpenCV, display it, and exit the capture window upon pressing the 'q' key. It provides two options: capturing video from a file or capturing video from your webcam.

**Code Explanation:**

1. Import OpenCV:
   ```python
   import cv2
   ```

   This line imports the OpenCV library, which is used for computer vision and video processing tasks.

2. Video Capture Initialization (Choose one of the following):

   - To capture video from a file (e.g., "video.mp4"):
     ```python
     cap = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4")
     ```

   - To capture video from your webcam (using the default webcam, index 0):
     ```python
     cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
     ```

   You can comment/uncomment the appropriate line based on your preference.

3. Video Capture Loop:
   ```python
   while True:
   ```

   This creates an infinite loop that continuously captures and displays video frames.

4. Capture a Frame:
   ```python
   ret, img = cap.read()
   ```

   Within the loop, `cap.read()` reads a frame from the video source. The result is stored in `img`, and `ret` indicates whether the frame was successfully read.

5. Display the Video:
   ```python
   cv2.imshow("video", img)
   ```

   `cv2.imshow()` displays the current video frame in a window titled "video."

6. Exit on 'q' Key Press:
   ```python
   if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
       break
   ```

   This part of the code waits for a key press using `cv2.waitKey(1)`. If the key pressed is 'q' (the ord('q') value), the loop breaks, and the program exits.

7. Cleanup:
   ```python
   cap.release()
   cv2.destroyAllWindows()
   ```

   After exiting the loop, `cap.release()` releases the video capture object, and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` closes all open windows.

**Note:**
- Make sure you have OpenCV installed.
- You can replace `"video.mp4"` with the path to your video file if you choose to capture video from a file.
- Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to access your webcam if you choose to capture video from the webcam.

This code can serve as a starting point for real-time video processing and analysis tasks using OpenCV.
